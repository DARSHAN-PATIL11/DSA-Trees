# DSA - Trees

This repository contains structured resources to help understand and implement tree data structures in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). The content is well-organized into conceptual notes, code examples, and practice problems to support both academic learning and interview preparation.

## Folder Structure

- `ConceptualNotes/`  
  Contains handwritten and digital notes explaining fundamental concepts, types of trees, traversal techniques, and common tree problems.

- `Code/`  
  Includes Java implementations of various tree operations and algorithms such as:
  - Binary Trees
  - Binary Search Trees (BST)
  - AVL Trees
  - Tree traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder)
  - LCA, height, diameter, and more

- `Practice/`  
  A collection of practice problems and their solutions. This includes problem statements, logic breakdown, and corresponding Java code.

- `Resources/`  
  Supplementary material including references, diagrams, cheat sheets, and important formulas related to trees in DSA.

## How to Use

1. Start by reviewing the notes in `ConceptualNotes/`.
2. Refer to the `Code/` directory to understand Java implementations of tree operations.
3. Solve problems from the `Practice/` folder to strengthen your understanding.
4. Use the `Resources/` folder for revision and quick reference.
