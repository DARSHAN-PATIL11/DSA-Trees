# Introduction to Tree Data Structures

This section provides a basic overview of tree data structures and related terminology.

## What is a Tree?

A tree is a non-linear, hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. It begins with a root node and extends into branches and leaves.

## Terminology

- Node: An element in a tree.
- Root: The topmost node in a tree.
- Parent: A node that has child nodes.
- Child: A node that descends from another node.
- Leaf: A node with no children.
- Edge: The connection between one node and another.
- Subtree: A tree formed from any node and its descendants.
- Height: The number of edges on the longest downward path from the node to a leaf.
- Depth: The number of edges from the root to the node.

## Applications

- File systems
- Databases
- Network routing algorithms
- Parsing expressions in compilers
